When dealing with function pointers, some asm-codes or other executable code, you always need virtual memory in your program.
If you deal with many in your code you need the help of a convenient virtual memory manager.
As an example, the demo just allocates some blocks of virtual memory, writes an array of random data to it and reads it again to see the data sits correctly in the virtual memory.
